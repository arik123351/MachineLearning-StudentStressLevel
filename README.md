In this project, we explored a neural network machine learning model. We used the mdsultanulislamovi/student-stress-monitoring-datasets dataset and built a full neural network model on it. In addition, we applied dimensionality reduction using PCA, retaining 90% and 95% of the variance (referred to as PCA90 and PCA95), in order to test whether the number of features could be reduced without significantly impacting the model’s accuracy. Finally, we compared the neural network’s performance with several other machine learning models, including XGBoost, SVM, and AdaBoost, to evaluate how well the neural network performs relative to other approaches.
